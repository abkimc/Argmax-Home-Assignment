       "   'description': \"This sauce began as a dare to top an ex-boyfriend's father's locally famous sauce. Something magical happens when it hits the grill! Don't forget to add to the ribs in the last 5 to 10 minutes of cooking, or else the high sugar content will scorch. Don't let the strong smell of vinegar scare you while cooking; the flavor of the sauce after cooking does not reflect the scent that fills the kitchen while cooking.\",\n",

    "# 3. Nutrition Database handling for the Keto classifier \n",
    "\n",
    "To support the keto diet classification system, I implemented a comprehensive nutrition database preprocessing pipeline using the USDA SR Legacy dataset. This involved converting the raw USDA text files into a clean, structured format suitable for nutritional analysis.\n",
    "The USDA SR Legacy dataset comes in a legacy tilde/caret delimited format across multiple text files (FOOD_DES.txt, NUTR_DEF.txt, and NUT_DATA.txt). I developed a parsing system that handles the specific encoding requirements (latin1) and delimiter structure ('^' separated with '~' quote characters) of these legacy files.\n",
    "The preprocessing pipeline performs several key transformations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Integration: Merges food descriptions, nutrient definitions, and nutritional values from separate files into a unified dataset\n",
    "Nutrient Filtering: Extracts only the macronutrients essential for keto classification - carbohydrates, protein, and sugar content\n",
    "Data Restructuring: Converts the normalized database structure into a wide-format table where each food item has its nutritional values as columns\n",
    "Data Cleaning: Standardizes food names to lowercase, handles missing values by filling with zeros, and ensures consistent column naming\n",
    "\n",
    "The final output is a clean CSV database containing food names paired with their macronutrient profiles (carbs, protein, sugar), which serves as the nutritional reference for determining whether ingredients align with ketogenic diet requirements. This structured approach enables efficient lookup and classification of ingredients based on their nutritional composition rather than relying solely on keyword matching."

    "# 4. keto classifier \n",
    "\n",
    "This part uses a combination of rule-based logic and data-driven analysis. It begins with two manually curated keyword sets: one for known keto-friendly ingredients (e.g., meats, oils, low-carb vegetables) and another for non-keto ingredients (e.g., grains, sugars, high-carb fruits). These lists enable fast, accurate classification without requiring a database lookup for common cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an ingredient is not matched by the keyword rules, the system performs a fuzzy search against a nutritional database to find the closest match. It uses a high-confidence threshold (90%) to ensure reliability and checks the matched item’s carbohydrate content per 100g against a predefined keto threshold (10g). Unrecognized or low-confidence matches are conservatively treated as high-carb to avoid misclassification.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system includes support for caching, logging failed lookups, and optional debug output. Its design prioritizes accuracy, conservative classification, and runtime efficiency, making it suitable for integration into larger applications such as dietary tracking tools or meal planners.\n"
